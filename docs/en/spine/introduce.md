## Spine Tools

To create animations for "Don't Starve" using Spine, **What you see is what you get**, and address potential issues that may arise during animation production, such as:

1. Incorrect layer names after unpacking and repacking, causing the Hide/Show functionality to fail.
2. Mismatched frame rates: animation packed at 40 fps while the game runs at 30 fps.
3. Errors in image data after unpacking and repacking, leading to animation issues.
4. Duration errors after unpacking and repacking, resulting in animation issues (e.g., hand layer not displaying).
5. Incompatibility with unpacking a single bank and multiple builds together, leading to missing symbols after unpacking and errors after repacking (e.g., missing snow layers in animations).
6. Incorrect automatic frame insertion during packing, causing inconsistencies between editor and game animations.
7. Spriter does not support skewed animations, leading to errors in unpacked animations.
