## Subscription

This tool allows you to compile Spine animation files into a format compatible with "Don't Starve" and to convert "Don't Starve" animation files for import into Spine Editor for editing.

Compiling Spine files into a format for "Don't Starve" will not preserve skeletal animation data, so please ensure that you keep the original project files.

Unpacking "Don't Starve" files into a Spine project will not export skeletal data; you will need to manually recreate the skeleton. Some complex animation packs may export with inaccurate transformations, requiring manual adjustments.

Spine-related features are a paid service. Please contact the author for purchase. Dscord: https://discord.gg/78Y4FaGq3U.

Please note that there are no refunds service.
